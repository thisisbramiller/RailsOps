# RailsOps: Orchestrating DevOps for Ruby on Rails Web App

## Overview

RailsOps is a project dedicated to architecting a robust infrastructure and implementing an efficient DevOps pipeline for a Ruby on Rails-based e-commerce platform. By integrating Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, cloud technologies, and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, RailsOps aims to ensure the reliability, scalability, and security of the web application while facilitating streamlined development and deployment workflows.

## Features

- **Infrastructure Automation**: Utilizes Terraform for provisioning and managing AWS resources, ensuring consistency and repeatability in infrastructure configuration.
  
- **Containerization and Orchestration**: Dockerizes the Ruby on Rails web app and orchestrates deployments using Kubernetes, enabling efficient scaling and management of containerized applications.

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implements a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate builds, tests, and deployments, promoting rapid and reliable delivery of code changes to production.

- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Configures Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring system performance and tracking metrics, with alerting capabilities to detect and respond to anomalies effectively.

- **Security Measures**: Implements SSL/TLS encryption, RBAC policies, and vulnerability scanning to enhance the security posture of the application and infrastructure.
